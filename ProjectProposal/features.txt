Connections Project

This project is modeled after Padlet but with features to support mathematics learning routines such as "What do you notice?" and "Connection Representations".  It allows a teacher to insert an image and modify the text and instructions to students.  Students post observations on a wall below the image.  Students may also be asked to "like" posts that reflect mathematical insight and provide justification for their selections. The teacher can connect 2 lessons each with a single image to create a connect lesson where students are challenged to make connections between the images.
